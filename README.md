# Mips Processor (CPU v1.0)
This repository contains my Verilog Hardware Design project of a single-cycle Mips processor.
The project has a file called +about.pdf that contains the project description/details

#### Software
* Quartus Prime

#### Hardware
* Altera D2

#### Operational System
* Windows 10

### Project Overview

I designed a Mips-type single cycle process. The processor has an ALU, register bank, control unit, memories, branch instructions and parallel inputs and outputs. Using Quartus prime I connect to the AlteraD2 FPGA.

### Learning Objectives
* Design a CPU, starting with only a textual description of its operation.
* Implement a digital design using the Verilog HDL.
